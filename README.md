# enzymodel

## Motivation
Enzyme modeling as a course of study is in dire need of systematization. Many disparate analyses across the discipline have been proposed, but they need to be integrated into a coherent whole in order to provide predictive capacity.

In order to facilitate this, `enzymodeling` is being developed in three capacities:
1. A repository of features corresponding to the [[contributions to catalysis]()].
2. Evaluation of these features in enzyme and non-enzyme protein structures using deep learning.
3. An API that provides sensible access to (1) and (2).
